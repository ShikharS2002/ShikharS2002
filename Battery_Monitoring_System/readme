This project aims to create a battery monitoring system using Arduino Uno.
The objective is to monitor the voltage of the batteries and show the current and temperature values.
If a battery is faulty i.e voltage less than 2V a fault indicator LED will be turned on and if the temperature rises above 40 degrees an alert buzzer is sounded.
If cumulative voltage of all 3 batteries is less than a threshold value of 5V the relay is used to disconnect the load from the battery pack.
