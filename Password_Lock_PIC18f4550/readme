This project aims at building a password lock using PIC18f4550 controller a 4 x 4 keypad and an LCD.
At first the controller asks for the user to enter the password he wants.
Then the PIC controller sets the password and is in the locked state. It then asks the user for the correct password to unlock it.
If the users enters the same password that he sets the controller unlocks and displays unlocked. Then the user must push the ON/C button to relock the controller.
When the button is pressed the controller relocks and again asks the user to enter the password to unlock it.
Locking and Unlocking action is simulated by a stepper motor which acts as the locking mechanism. When vertical it represents locked state when horizontal it is unlocked state.
A buzzer is sounded three times when an incorrect password is entered.

Demonstration Video: - Work in Progress.

The pdsrpj and hex files can be used to simulate the password lock.
