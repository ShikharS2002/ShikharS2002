This project aims to build a weather monitoring system using Arduino Uno and ESP 01 wifi module, which can transmit and store it's data on the thinkspeak IoT cloud.
The Uno controller monitors the temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity and rainfall using DHT11, BMP180 and rainfall sensors.
All readings are shown on a LCD as well as transmitted to the thinkspeak IoT cloud.
All readings can be viewed as a chart on the thinkspeak cloud.

Video Demonstration: - Work in Progress.

The pdsrpj and hex files can be used to simulate the project.
