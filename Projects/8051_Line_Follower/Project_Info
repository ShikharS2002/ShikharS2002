The Line follower is designed to follow a white line.
When both sensors detect a white line the bot is stopped.
When neither sensor detects a white line the robot moves forward.
When only 1 sensor detects a white line the robot turns accordingly to follow the line.

The proteus pdsrpj file can be used along with the line_follower.hex file to simulate the line follower.
